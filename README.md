## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

In this section, I've implemented a basic Artificial Neural Network. The model is trained on [`Churn_Modelling.csv`] to classify/predict [`Customers of a bank who are willing to leave`]. 

Key learning points:
- Understanding the basic building blocks of neural networks.
- Learning about activation functions, forward propagation, and backpropagation.

## AutoEncoders

AutoEncoders are a type of neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data. Here, I've experimented with both basic and variational AutoEncoders.

Key learning points:
- Understanding the concept of dimensionality reduction.
- Exploring different architectures like vanilla and variational AutoEncoders.

## Boltzmann Machines

Boltzmann Machines are used for learning probability distributions over inputs. I implemented a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to explore its potential.

Key learning points:
- Understanding the theory behind probabilistic graphical models.
- Implementing a simple RBM and understanding its applications in feature extraction.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNNs are widely used for image processing tasks. I've used CNNs to classify [Images of cats and dogs 10,000 images in the `dataset` file].

Key learning points:
- Learning about convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- Understanding how CNNs are used for image classification tasks.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

RNNs are powerful for sequence-based data like time series or natural language. I experimented with basic RNNs, LSTM, and GRU cells.

Key learning points:
- Understanding how RNNs maintain context with sequential data.
- Implementing LSTM and GRU cells to solve sequence prediction problems.

## Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

Self-Organizing Maps are a type of unsupervised learning, mainly used for dimensionality reduction and clustering.

Key learning points:
- Learning the basics of SOMs and how they organize data into a meaningful pattern.
- Implementing a SOM and visualizing its clustering capabilities.
